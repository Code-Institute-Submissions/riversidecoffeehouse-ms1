# Riverside Coffeehouse - Milestone Project

Introduction
==

NOTE: **_The Riverside Coffeehouse does not exist._**

Welcome to my first milestone project, Riverside Coffeehouse.

The justification for this project is to show what I have learned so far.

During the course of the Milestone Project I will define ths steps, technologies and resources I have used to build the project. All the while keeping focus on the User Centered Design process.

## User Experience Design



Part of the User Centric Frontend course touches upon Jesse James Garrett's, "The Elements of User Experience". Originally intended for the web, the strategies outlined in his book "The Elements of User Experience" were adapted in other fields like software development and industrial design.

Our goals as a developer are to get the balance right between User Needs/Goals and Business Needs/Goals. We can do this by following Jesse's five-plane model.

### Goals of the site

* Be informative
* Be accessible
* Be clean, simple & effective
* Be an online representation of the Riverside Coffeehouse
* Demographic - teens, students, adults & familes

### Demographic

Riverside Coffeehouse has a wide audience and want to target the site towards adults, teenagers and families. With this being such a wide audience I thought it best to include certain features that are at the Coffeehouse. 

Teenagers are socially driven, so having a social media presence is considered essential if we are to attract their attention. The ability to check-in to a location will hopefully increase footfall. Advertising Free Wi-fi is also more likely to entice teenagers.

Students are always on the look out for cheap deals. Incentives such as discounts via the NUS card are always welcomed. Advertising this in the site will likely increase footfall from this demographic.

Adults see a coffee-shop as a flexible work location, a relaxed social space and even a quality time with a book. We aim to target this demographic with the advertisement of quieter spaces on-site and study corners.

Families, as the father of two very hungry, almost teenagers we are constantly looking out for Kids Eat Free promotions/offers. Informing potential customers that this is available will likely draw in this demographic.


### User Stories

First Time Visitor Goals

- As a first-time visitor I want to be able to understand what the purpose of the site is.
- As a first-time visitor I want to be able to navigate easily without confusion.
- As a first-time visitor I want to be able view some products.
- As a first-time visitor I want to be able to view location information/opening times.

Returning Visitor Goals 

- As a returning-visitor I want to be able to get in contact with the owners of the business using both contact forms and external social media.
- As a returning-visitor I want to be able to access a downloadable menu.


### Business Goals

- The business wants to be seen as having an online presence.
- The business wants to promote their range of products.
- The business wants to be able to be contacted easily.
- The business wants to be able to receive orders online.
- The business wants social media interaction.


Using the site goals, user stories & business goals defined above I am able to gain a better picture/understanding of what is needed to create a well balanced user centric site.

### Strategy Trade offs

Taking all of the above into consideration I can move onto creating a feasibility/viability study. What features can we include? What just isn't quite possible yet?

| Opportunity / Problem / Feature        | Importance  | Viability/Feasibility |
| -------------                          |:---:        | -----:    |
| A. Online Ordering                        | 3           |   1       |
| B. Google Maps Location                   | 3           |   5       |
| C. Contact Form                           | 4           |   5       |
| D. Menu/Product Page(images )             | 5           |   5       |
| E. Social Media                           | 4           |   5       |            
### Order of priority/feasibility:-

D - Menu/Product Page is critical for the business and user. It is also viable from a developer perspective.

C, E - Contact Form and Social media are both viable and important from a business perspective/user perspective.

B - Google Maps location whilst it isn't critical, as we could use an address instead of a map, it is however viable so likely to be included.

A - Online Ordering - given the timescale for the project, technical complexity I feel this isn't feasible at this stage. 



## Scope

- What they say they need?
    - The client wants a professional, mobile-friendly, clean site which would start their journey into the online business space. 
    - The client wants to add social media to their site via a link.
    - The client wants a menu/product page - this is vital.
    - The client wants to be able to be contaced by the user using a form.
    - Finally, the client wants to allow online ordering to increase sales. Given the timescale and the complexity of the job which is beyond the scope of the MS1 project, this would have to be added in a later release.

- What they actually need?
    - Riverside Coffeehouse will benefit from having a mobile-first site.
    - An introduction portion to the Coffeehouse will also be needed to address User Goals.
    - The client wants a menu/product, so they will need downloadable menus.
    - The client will need social media icons to link to their social media site. 
    - The client needs a contact form to better connect with users.

- What they don't know they need?

    - Opening times
    - Food Hygiene Ratings
    - Privacy Policy
    - Cookies Policy
